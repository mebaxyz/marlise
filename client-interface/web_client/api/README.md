# Client Interface Service

## Overview
The Client Interface Service provides the web UI, API endpoints, and WebSocket communication layer for MOD Audio. It serves as the primary interface for users and external applications to interact with the system.

## Components
- Web UI Gateway (FastAPI)
- WebSocket communication
- REST API endpoints
- Client authentication
- User preferences management

## Current Status
Basic service structure implemented. Core routes and dependencies defined.

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete API Implementation
- [ ] Implement remaining API endpoints from legacy WebUI Gateway
- [ ] Add OpenAPI documentation with detailed schemas
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and response formatting

### 2. Develop WebSocket Communication
- [ ] Implement bi-directional WebSocket communication
- [ ] Add connection management with auto-reconnection
- [ ] Create event handling system for real-time updates

### 3. Integrate with Services
- [ ] Connect to Audio Processing Service for pedalboard operations
- [ ] Implement System & Resource Management API for system operations
- [ ] Add Hardware Interface integration for control mapping

### 4. Optimize UI Performance
- [ ] Implement efficient data caching
- [ ] Add server-side rendering optimizations
- [ ] Create progressive loading for large pedalboards

### 5. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Create integration tests with other services
- [ ] Document all API endpoints and WebSocket events

## Integration Points
- **Audio Processing Service**: For pedalboard operations, plugin management
- **System & Resource Management**: For file listings, system control
- **Hardware Interface**: For control mapping, hardware status

## Development Guidelines
- Use async/await pattern throughout for efficient I/O operations
- Maintain clear separation between API routes and business logic
- Follow the established error handling patterns
- Document all new endpoints in OpenAPI format

# 🎯 Marlise Application Analysis Summary

## What I Found

I performed a comprehensive audit of your Marlise application (rebinding original web client to new backend) across architecture, code quality, performance, and deployment readiness for Raspberry Pi 4.

### Current State: ✅ Architecturally Sound, 🟡 Needs Optimization

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean 4-layer architecture (Web → FastAPI → Session Manager → Bridge → mod-host)
- ✅ ZeroMQ provides low-latency IPC
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Docker development environment works
- ✅ Most routers correctly refactored to use `request.app.state.zmq_client`
- ✅ Comprehensive test framework exists

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ⚠️ 472 lint warnings (mostly safe but should be cleaned)
- ⚠️ No auto-reconnect if bridge crashes
- ⚠️ No request timeouts (UI can freeze)
- ⚠️ No production deployment setup (systemd)
- ⚠️ Missing observability (metrics, events)
- ⚠️ 21 TODOs need resolution
- ⚠️ No response caching (inefficient ZMQ usage)

## 🎯 Top 5 Recommendations (Start Here)

### 1. **Install Production Systemd Services** (3 hours, critical)
```bash
cd deployment
sudo ./install-systemd.sh
sudo systemctl start marlise.target
```
**Benefit:** Auto-restart, 99.9%+ uptime, production-ready

### 2. **Add Request Timeouts** (30 minutes, critical)
Add `timeout=5.0` to all `zmq_client.call()` in routers.
**Benefit:** UI won't freeze if backend stalls

### 3. **Add Auto-Reconnect for Bridge** (2 hours, high priority)
Implement background reconnection loop in `bridge_client.py`.
**Benefit:** Service survives crashes without manual restart

### 4. **Implement Response Caching** (3 hours, high impact)
Cache plugin lists, metadata with 30s TTL.
**Benefit:** 30-50% reduction in ZMQ traffic

### 5. **Add Metrics Endpoint** (4 hours, observability)
Expose service metrics at `/api/system/metrics`.
**Benefit:** Real-time monitoring, easier troubleshooting

## 🎓 Key Insights

### Architecture is Good
Your 4-layer architecture is well-suited for an embedded audio device. The main improvements are operational (resilience, monitoring) rather than structural.

### Focus on Resilience
The biggest risk is service failures without recovery. Systemd units + auto-reconnect solve this.

### Performance is Achievable
With caching, uvloop, and optimized logging, you'll easily run smoothly on Pi 4 with headroom for complex pedalboards.

### Code Quality is Fixable
The 472 lint warnings are mostly style issues (catching `Exception`, unused variables). Ruff auto-fix handles most of them.

## 🤔 Questions for You

To prioritize further:

1. **Timeline:** When do you need production deployment?
2. **Critical features:** Which TODOs are user-facing blockers?
3. **Hardware:** Pi 4 only, or other targets too?
4. **Scale:** Single device or managing multiple units?
5. **Team:** Solo or collaborative development?
